This is my blog about software development.

I was always wondering how someone can have enough time to write some blog with rich content. Meanwhile I have accumulated solid amount of knowledge which I don't have with who to share. My friends and family don't plan on learning some programming language, and I don't get to see my friends programmers often enough so we could spend all of our time talking about work. My wish is to share my ideas, findings and thoughts on this blog and to hear your opinion about them. IT is to complex to be tackled down without synergy.

So much for introduction...let the games begin.
