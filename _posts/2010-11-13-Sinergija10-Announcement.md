I would also like to recommend another presentation held by my friend and personal JavaScript super hero[ Aleksandar Mirilović][5] from[ DotExe][6] led on Tuesday 16.11.2010. Aleksandar will be presenting DotExe Development Platform (DXD). 

DXD is a framework for creating desktop-like web applications without knowing HTML, JavaScript or CSS based on MS ASP.NET 3.5 and Sencha ExtJS. Applications are built using DXD Designer, which is implemented as a Visual Studio Package and also as a "stand alone" application. DXD Designer enables ExtJS forms generation from the Windows Forms Designer which can be run in all leading browsers (Internet Explorer 6, Mozilla Firefox 3, Google Chrome 3, Safari, Opera ...). 

The main advantage of this platform, compared to a conventional web application development, is that it allows huge savings in development time thanks to its complete automation of: a client-server communication, data synchronization and ExtJS forms generation, which allow writing complete rich web applications without a single line of JavaScript. You can see the demo[ here][7].
