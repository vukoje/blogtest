Yesterday I held presentation about Code Refactoring at Microsoft Serbia quarters in Belgrade. Main focus of this presentation was how to improve quality of code and what are the benefits of code quality.

Because of the last night games, we didn't cover Coding Standard, Code Review and available tools for checking code quality and refactoring it. These topics will be covered in next presentation for which date is not yet set. Below is last night presentation. If you have any questions about it, please share them with us, I would be happy to apply.

You can donload presentation [here][2] or browse it online [here][3].
