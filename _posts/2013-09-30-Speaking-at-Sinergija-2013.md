![SinergijaLogo][1]

I will be speaking at this year's [Sinergija][2].

Presentation is titled _**State of the art logging**_ and here are my incomplete notes for it:

* How to build state of the art production system instrumenting so you can easily understand what is going on in your production system?
* Which component to use? [Log4Net][3], [NLog][4], System.Trace, custom solutionâ€¦
* Event vs. Trace (Monitoring vs. Performance)
* [Negative events][5]
* Tracing steps with "using" notation (e.g. [MiniProfiler][6])
* [AOP][7] vs. [manual logging][8]
* Where to output data?
* How to scope data?
* How not to kill app performance?
* How to bake in app profiler in your tracing lib?
* Demo of [Webcom][9] powerful GUI for trace analytics system.
* Demo of AOP logging in MVC web app using NLog.
