Thanks to [Sorpex](http://www.soprex.com) I had a great pleasure to visit this year [TechEd](http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/details/PRE051-WC?fbid=icMFnTHasPG#webcast) held in Atlanta. I got a chance to attend many interesting talks and also meet the people from Microsoft that build the tools I have been using for years. In the focus of the conference were the Cloud, Windows Phone and Application Lifecycle Management.

Here are the most interesting sessions available online that I recommend:

[The Future of Microsoft Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/FDN03)

> Exciting introduction to new VS and TFS capabilities. I especially liked:
> - Analyzing code for Code Clones / Find Matching Code feature – tries to discover code clones that are usually result of code Copy/Paste.
> - Support for Code Review workflow through work items and code commenting like in Word.

[Deep Dive into Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2010 Reporting](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV311)

> What reports are waiting for you in TFS and how you can add custom reports.

[Branching and Merging for Parallel Development](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV306)

> Excellent introduction to Branching strategies (by Release/Stability/Feature). Here are some of advices I found most useful:
> - Avoid branching when possible. If it gets complicated, you will need full time release manager.
> - Avoid cherry pick merge (partial merge).
> - Always merge on branch that changes more (Merge down copy up pattern).
> - Use branches to store releases instead of labels because labels can change and there is no version history support.
> - Each branch is expensive because each has to have its own test environment and continues integration support.

[Test Automation with Microsoft VS 2010: Coded UI Tests and Lab Management](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV309)

> This testing tool looks very impressive. The time will show how it will fit real life needs.

[NuGet: Microsoft .NET Package Management for the Enterprise](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV338)

> Great simplification of libraries distribution on the internet and inside companies.

[Microsoft Visual Studio IDE Futures](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV326)

> New VS is faster, simpler and more user friendly (parallel builds, less memory usage, async GUI, pinned tabs, enhanced search and navigation…)

[Busy Microsoft .NET Developer’s Guide to the Microsoft Cloud](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV351)

> You are thinking about the cloud? Listen to this scary real life stories and think again.

[Introducing Microsoft SQL Server Developer Tools, Code-Named "Juneau"](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV207)

> Impressive capabilities added to SQL server tools that could greatly simplify developer lives when it comes to database maintenance (DB compare/sync, Local DB runtime, Find All References on DB objects and Refactoring tools).

[AppFabric Caching: How It Works and When You Should Use It](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/MID302)

> Great introduction to MS distributed cache.

[Efficient T-SQL Querying with Itzik Ben-Gan](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DBI310)

[Creating and Consuming Open Data Protocol (OData) Services](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV308)
