Last night I have held presentation about Coding Standard and Code Review at Microsoft Serbia quarters in Belgrade. This was resumption of [previous presentation on Code Refactoring](../../post/2009/09/10/Code-Refactoring-Presentation.aspx). In amazing 3 hours I have managed to break every record (rule) regarding presentation length, so I want to thank all of you who came and survived. I know it was hard but I can only hope that it was useful.

For all of you who are interested in these subjects but couldnâ€™t make it, I will be holding these two presentations in November at [Sinergija](http://www.mssinergija.net/).

You can download presentation [here](http://vukoje.net/file.axd?file=2009%2f10%2fCS+%26+CR.pptx) or browse it online [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/20500871/VukojeNET-Coding-Standard-Code-Review), and see photographs [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/vukoje/CASAPredavanje?feat=directlink).
