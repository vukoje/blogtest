As I already announced, I have held two presentations at [Sinergija 2009](http://www.mssinergija.net/index_en.html) in Belgrade. Presentations were on the same subject as my [previous](http://vukoje.net/post/2009/09/10/Code-Refactoring-Presentation.aspx) [two](http://vukoje.net/post/2009/10/01/Presentation-Coding-Standard-and-Code-Review.aspx) presentations in .NET Belgrade user group, only this time they were more refined (I hope). I approximate that I had around 100 listeners at both presentations which is my new record :)
