I just wrote another code project article - [Attaching detached POCO to EF DbContext - simple and fast](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/576330/Attaching-detached-POCO-to-EF-DbContext-simple-and).

> _Simple generic extension method that will attach detached POCO to DbContext without reloading it form DB_.
